          Currently at 4th year. During my engineering studies in Computer
          Science, I gained extensive knowledge and practical skills in key
          areas of the field. I studied advanced algorithms and object-oriented
          programming, primarily using Java. As part of my coursework, I
          developed Android applications in Java, which helped me build
          expertise in mobile programming. I also worked with SQL Server
          databases, learning how to design and manage relational databases.
          Additionally, I was introduced to PHP and the basics of the Laravel
          framework, which enabled me to create dynamic web applications.
